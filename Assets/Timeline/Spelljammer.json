The Skyward Realms, as the space mariners of Netheril called Realmspace, was believed to be the next great frontier for raw materials, such as mined ores, spellcraft, and discovered magical items. The Netherese explorers, however, were also responsible for racial experiments, basically vivisecting anything they ran across. This gave the Netherese, the only Faerunian humans to have ventured into Realmspace up until 2618, a very bad name and a horrid reputation-akin to the fear generated when an illithid spelljamming ship was seen. This dread did nothing but separate the Netherese from the spelljamming community already in space and made trade nearly impossible. In fact, Netherese ships were attacked on sight. Oberon, an arcanist born during this time in Netheril's history, tried his best to mend his nation's reputation in space, but it was to no avail. One hundred years after the first ship ventured above Toril's surface, Netheril recalled the last one. The tremendous expense of armoring and defending their ships far exceeded any profits to be made in Realmspace. Since the Netherese were unsuccessful in creating their own helms and other spelljamming items-being forced to rely on the Arcane for such materials- they decided to drop out of Realmspace. Oberon, distraught over the loss of his love, moved to Yeoman's Loft and attempted to maintain a presence in Realmspace. Even his death 10 years later didn't hamper Netheril's presence, as others who felt and shared his dedication continued in his wake.

            "description": "[FR] The Weeping War was the decades long conflict between the Army of Darkness and the elven city of Myth Drannor on Faerun. A long incident in this conflict was the campaign known as the three Greenwing Wars. These three battles were so named for Myth Drannor's primary ally in waging them, an elven man-o-war. Responding to a magical plea for help from a grounded ally among Cormanthyr's wizards, the Elven Imperial Fleet of Realmspace sent Captain Oncith Ilbenalu to aid the elves with his green crystalline-winged man-o-war, the MONARCH MORDENT, and his trusted crew of bards, wizards, and crack archers. Dominating the three battles in which it participated, the Monarch provided air cover and heavy weaponry with its ballistae and catapult that aided the ground troops immeasurably. In fact, its arrival changed the tide of the war in the northern forest and gave the outmatched and outnumbered elves some significant victories. With the Third Greenwing War, Captain Oncith's pride overcame his sense as he maneuvered so close to the treetops and the Army of Darkness forces that his helmsman could not maneuver effectively. When Gaulguth the Nycaloth flew skyward, there was little beyond ineffectual missile fire to stop him from using his great axe, Heartcleaver, to shatter one of the ship's wings at its base! With the magical shock slaying the helmsman immediately, the MONARCH MORDENT crashed into the trees and atop nearly 200 members of the Army of Darkness. Since that lost battle, the photosynthetic wings continued to grow, and large crystalline webworks wrapped around the clearings and the trees in this northern glade now called Monarch's Fall Glade. While most animals shun the amber-and-emerald crystal webs and walls, many elves used this as a redoubt and shelter both during and long after the Weeping War.

The scro Tarantula Fleet is approached by the undead Neogi mage Skarkesh, who forms an alliance with them to recover the Cloak of the First Pilot from the Cloakmaster, Teldin Moore. This attempt encompasses four battles, as the Imperial Elven Fleet squadron stationed at the Rock of Bral (previously unaware of the Scro conquest of Spiral) fights to gain the Cloak for its commander, Admiral Uliananon Cirathorn.\nThe Battle of Ironpiece. The Scro fleet (27 ships strong), along with Skarkesh's pyramid ship, intercepts Teldin Moore aboard the hammership PROBE as it is about to make planetfall on the gnome colony world of Ironpiece. The Imperial Elven squadron (five ships strong) intervenes, and a gnomish fleet from Ironpiece arrives as well, leading to a confusing, three-way battle. When the hours long contest is over, the scro have lost two viperships, three scorpionships, two waspships, and one mammothship. The Elves lost one man-o-war, and had another damaged, and the gnomes lost a sidewheeler and several small spellfighters. This battle is generally seen as a gnomish victory as they drive the other two fleets from their colony world.\n{The Maelstrom's Eye, pp89-112}\nThe Raid on Port Walkaway. Still determined to acquire the Cloak of the First Pilot, the Scro launch a raid on the gnomish naval base of Port Walkaway. The attack is a disaster, as the elves had warned the gnomes of it in advance (hoping to patch up relations after accidentally firing on gnomish vessels in the previous battle). Of the twelve vessels the Scro dispatched on the raid, only five survived. The gnomes lost seven small craft and had two large ships destroyed on the ground, as well as some buildings burned. Teldin Moore fled during the battle on the gnomish experimental vessel PERILOUS HALIBUT, heading for Herdspace.\n{The Maelstrom's Eye, 143-156}\nThe Battle of the Cloaked Ships. Realizing the elves were employing cloaking helms, the scro and Skarkesh developed a powder they could jettison to reveal the men-o-war. When two of the elven men-o-war crept in close to investigate the Tarantula Fleet, this technique was used. One of the men-o-war was destroyed, the other damaged but the scro suffered no losses.\n{The Maelstrom's Eye, p158}\nThe Battle of Herdspace. A final battle is fought in Herdspace as the Imperial Elven squadron and the Tarantula fleets fight over the Cloak of the First Pilot. Losses are severe on all sides. The elves lose two men-o-war and an armada, only one man-o-war of the squadron survives the campaign to return to the Rock of Bral. The Tarantula fleet loses the pyramidship, a squidship, and a scorpionship. Only ten of the original 27 Tarantula fleet vessels survive the campaign to return to Spiral. Admiral Cirathorn of the IEN, as well as the scro commanders Admiral Halker and General Vorr, all perish as well. Teldin Moore and the Cloak of the First Pilot survive to continue his quest.\n{The Maelstrom's Eye, pp280-294}\n[SJ] Lar, an elven world in a remote crystal sphere, is destroyed by the scro.

Grimnosh's squadron of orcish allies escapes the Armistice blockade, destroying the IEN man-o-war WINDWALKER in the process.
